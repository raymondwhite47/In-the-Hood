# In_the_Hood

This folder contains a manually scaffolded Flutter application mirroring the default `flutter create` counter app. The tooling is not available in this environment, so the project was created by hand with the standard `main.dart`, lint configuration, and widget test template.

To complete platform-specific files, run the following on a machine with Flutter installed:

```bash
flutter create .
```

This will add Android, iOS, web, and other platform folders while preserving the existing Dart sources.
